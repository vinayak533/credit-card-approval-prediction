# 💳 Credit Card Approval Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning project that predicts whether a credit card application will be approved based on applicant data.  
It uses **supervised learning algorithms** and follows a complete **data science workflow** from raw data to final model evaluation.

## 📌 Project Overview
Credit card approval is a crucial decision-making process for banks and financial institutions.  
Traditionally, approval decisions depend on manual review, which is time-consuming and prone to human bias.  
This project aims to **automate the process** using machine learning models trained on applicant features.

## 📂 Project Workflow
1. **Import Libraries** – Load all required Python packages.
2. **Read Dataset** – Import the credit card application dataset.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Understand data distribution, spot patterns & outliers.
4. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** – Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, scale numerical data.
5. **Feature Selection** – Select important features that influence approval decisions.
6. **Model Training** – Train different ML algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression).
7. **Model Evaluation** – Use metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score to measure performance.
8. **Prediction** – Make predictions on new/unseen data.
